    <h1>Rules for DSA</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Rule 0</b>: Understand the problem and think of a brute force which can pass the example testcase</li>
      <li><b>Rule 1</b>: Only think the solution is done when the base cases are handled. That's the place for optimizations too.</li>
      <li><b>Rule 2</b>: 
        Though traversal means visiting each element, it doesn't always imply moving from start to end in case of linear data strcutures.
        It may also be from end to the start to solve the task efficiently and more logically.
      </li>
      <li>Memory Limit Exceeded isn't that common. So try to store everything and avoid TLE's</li>
      <li>The size of a data structure can be of any amount, try to reduce the number of traversals.</li>
      <li>Use of long long is underrated.</li>
      <li>At times, think from the perspective of STL</li>
      <li>You can't create an unordered map of pairs. It should be an ordered map.</li>
      <li>So you decided to solve something with maps, can you do it with strings too?</li>
      <li>While performing a remainder operator <code>n%d</code>, make sure that n is not negative, otherwise do <code>(n+d)%d</code> </li>
