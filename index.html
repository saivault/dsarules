    <h1>Rules for DSA</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Only think the solution is done when the base cases are handled.</li>
      <li>The size of a data structure can be of any amount, try to reduce the number of traversals.</li>
      <li>
        Though traversal means visiting each element, it doesn't always imply moving from start to end in case of linear data strcutures.
        It may also be from end to the start to solve the task efficiently and more logically.
      </li>
      <li>Use of long long is underrated.</li>
      <li>At times, think from the perspective of STL</li>
      <li>While performing a remainder operator <blockquote>n%d</blockquote>, make sure that n is not negative, otherwise do <blockquote>(n+d)%d</blockquote></li>
    </ul>
